WARNING: Behavioral models for independent clock FIFO configurations are not cycle-accurate. You may wish to choose the structural simulation model instead of the behavioral model. This will ensure accurate behavior and latencies during simulation. You can enable this from CORE Generator by selecting Project -> Project Options -> Generation tab -> Structural Simulation. See the FIFO Generator User Guide for more information.
